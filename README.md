# <Prework-Study-Guide Webpage>

## Description

When building this project, I was motivated to learn about some of the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. By completion, I had learned a few skills in each, reflected in the webpage. The four languages taught me how to push and pull files from my computer, Write the information necessary on the page, style it how I please, and interact with it's contents.

## Usage

Each topic(HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript), was necessary for me to complete this project. HTML helped with adding the text and picture to the page, CSS was what added color and text alignment, Git was for pulling and pushing the product between my computer and GitHub, and JavaScript helped with creating functions on the computer. All can be seen within the page.
